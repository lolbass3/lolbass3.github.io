                            Lowell Ringel is a bassist, composer, and educator originally from Hillsborough, North Carolina. He currently resides in Miami, Florida, where he makes a career regularly performing around South Florida with both his own projects and as a sideman. As a composer, Ringel’s music blends jazz sensibilities and classical vocabulary into compositions imbued with a rich color palette. Reminiscent at times of Claude Debussy and Charlie Haden, he seeks to explore how human emotion and interpersonal relationships can be expressed through music. His work as a composer and bandleader led to the release of his first CD with his chamber jazz collective, Threeplustwo, with an upcoming tour around the East Coast. He also toured Finland in 2018 with chamber music project Transatlanttiset, whose debut record is due to be released in late 2019.

                            As an educator, Ringel believes in developing his students to be complete bassists, versatile and comfortable in many different styles and genres of music. The lessons are highly personalized, and will allow the student to pursue their musical passions. This approach comes from his time at the Frost School of Music, where Dr. Chuck Bergeron mentored him. At Frost, Ringel received both his M.M. in Jazz Pedagogy and his B.M. in Studio Music and Jazz Performance. Ringel has extensive experience as both a bass and ensemble clinician, including teaching residencies at the University of North Florida, the University of North Carolina – Wilmington, and the 2016 Jalisco Jazz Festival in Guadalajara, Mexico.

                            As a sideman, Ringel has performed with esteemed artists such as Shelly Berg, Jamison Ross, Ignacio Berroa, Dafnis Prieto, Kemuel Roig, Brian Lynch, and Martin Bejerano. Performances of note include performing at the 2015 Monterey Jazz Festival, 2018 Jacksonville Jazz Festival, and the 2018 and 2019 GroundUP Festivals. On recordings, Ringel was a guest artist on Berroa’s 2017 release, “Straight Ahead from Havana.” He also played on Arturo Sandoval Band-alum Roig’s upcoming record, which is due to be released in 2019.
